## This is a simple tictactoe game.
#### The Opponenet picks whatever move randomly but I will make it pick moves more smartly whenever I update this code.


here's my small roadmap for this game:

- Ver 0.5: Essential features such as **being able to play against the computer**, **restart once the game is done**, etc.

- Version 0.8: **The opponent will react accordingly to player moves**.

- Version 1.0: **customizing the x and o symbol**, **polishing the css a lil more bit** **and maybe make a mobile version**
